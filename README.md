### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Aaradhya from IIT Roorkee, and I do Machine Learning. I enjoy making machines work on my commands(p.s. I like to code).
I am learning languages and frameworks for machine learning deployment, such as Python and TensorFlow. I also enjoy reading about robotics technology and its implementation in real-life applications.

You can connect on my LinkedIn [https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaradhyasaxena/] or email me at saxena4aaradhya@gmail.com
